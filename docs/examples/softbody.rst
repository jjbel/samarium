Softbody
========

This example simulates a `softbody <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-body_dynamics>`_ 
It models it as a grid of rigid particles joined by springs.
The springs are damped: they have parameters stiffness (the "spring constant") and damping.
Collisions as well as friction are handled bewteen the particles and the walls.
